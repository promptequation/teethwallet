This platform will allow for an electronic medical-dental clinical record, as well as access to various diagnostic and clinical risk determination systems, and monitoring of treatments carried out over time. Access to the platform and its data is differentiated according to the user's profile (patient, dentist and teaching/research centre) and within the legal framework in force. In addition, allowing differentiated access to patients enables them to be aware of their oral health status and to be systematically alerted with information bulletins on good clinical practices, control and maintenance needs of their oral health status and treatments performed, thus contributing to their oral health-related quality of life.",
